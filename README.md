## Microrchestra

##### A team project *(with [@Albert Jiang](https://github.com/albHun) as one of the teammates)* built with *BBC micro:bits* in 2016 ARM Hackathon by Cambridge University Engineering Society. 

It is a electronic instrument with automatic harmony, using 4 buzzers connected  to 4 *micro:bits* boards with 1 "master" and other 3 "slaves". The player uses the "master" board with different **orientation** (using the compass built-in) as different **octaves**, different **tilting** (using the accelerometer built-in) as different **pitches**. Everytime the player touches the ***pin0***, it play the current pitch with the name of the pitch displayed on the board, with automatic harmony produced by 3 "slaves" following *pentatonic harmony*.
